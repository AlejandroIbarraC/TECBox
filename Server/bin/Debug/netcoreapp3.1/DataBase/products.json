Then, she looked at me with the face of an angry duck and said: \u201CWhat\u2019s a box?\u201D The question made a sparky mess inside my tiny human mind until I took a step back(literally, I was about to fall into a river) and realized the truth. A box is whatever we want it to be.A box is everything, and nothing, at the same time. This concept changed the way I looked at the world, so of course, I decided to charge for it. That\u2019d be $20.Right down, Sir / Ma\u2019am.","barcode":"99999","seller":"Juancho","price":"20","paysTax":"true","discount":"0","entryDate":"1/1/2020","sales":"100"},{"name":"Box Jellyfish","description":"For this one, we really wanted to take it to the extreme.
